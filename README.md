## 📖 About This Application

Merowe-Dam-Water-Quality is a simple tool designed to help you monitor the water quality of the Merowe Dam in Sudan. It uses satellite images from Sentinel-2 and data from Google Earth Engine combined with analysis techniques to track water properties such as chlorophyll, turbidity, and other key water quality indicators.

This application does not require special skills. If you can download and run a program on your computer, you can use this tool. It provides a way to understand environmental conditions through clear visualizations and data on water quality.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Multi-parameter Water Quality Monitoring:** Check levels of chlorophyll, turbidity, Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), secchi depth, and other indicators.
- **Satellite Image Analysis:** Uses Sentinel-2 satellite pictures to collect data without needing physical water samples.
- **Google Earth Engine Integration:** Runs data processing in the cloud for fast results without heavy local computing.
- **Easy Visualizations:** Displays clear images and charts that show water quality over time.
- **No Programming Needed:** Designed for use by anyone interested in environmental monitoring.
- **Supports XArray Format:** Allows users working with advanced data tools to handle output easily.

## ▶️ Running the Application

1. **Open the Application**

   Use the shortcut created during installation or find the app in your program list.

2. **Connect to the Internet**

   The app needs online access to retrieve satellite images and compute water quality data.

3. **Select Data Parameters**

   You can choose which water quality indicators to view, such as chlorophyll levels or turbidity.

4. **View Results**

   The app shows maps, graphs, and numbers that display recent and historical water quality data.

5. **Export Reports**

   Save the data or images if you want to share or analyze them further.

## 🔧 Configuration Tips

- Keep your internet connection stable for accurate satellite data.
- Update the application regularly by checking the release page.
- For advanced users, exported data supports XArray format for further analysis.
- If you face issues, restart the app or check your firewall settings to ensure it can access the web.

## 💡 How It Works

Merowe-Dam-Water-Quality combines satellite imagery with algorithms that translate what the sensors see into useful water quality measures:

- **Satellite Imagery:** Sentinel-2 satellites pass over the dam regularly, capturing images in different spectral bands.
- **Google Earth Engine:** This cloud platform processes these images to extract environmental information.
- **Data Analysis:** The app interprets this data into familiar water quality terms such as chlorophyll concentration, which signals algae levels.
- **Presentation:** Results are shown visually and numerically to help you understand water clarity, pollution, and other factors.

Using satellites means you get up-to-date information without needing to go to the dam yourself.
